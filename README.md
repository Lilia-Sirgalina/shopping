## Project Description

**Shopping Store** is a small educational React project.  
The app displays product cards with images, descriptions, and prices.

At the top of the page, there are filter buttons that allow users to view specific product categories:
- Dresses
- Skirts
- Pants
- Shoes  
There is also a **"Show All"** button to display all products.

The application includes a navigation bar with three sections:

This project was built using React. The `.map()` method is used to render product cards, the `.filter()` method is used to filter products by category, and **React Router** is implemented to navigate between components via the navbar.
